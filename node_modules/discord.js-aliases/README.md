# discord.js-aliases
With the v11.1 update of discord.js deprecating a lot of methods we all use such as sendCode, sendMessage etc, and with their planned removal in v12 for a cleaner less bloated method we thought it would be best to make this addon to help future new coders ease into the new methods.

## Usage
Require discord.js then require the addon under it, e.g:
```js
const Discord = require('discord.js');
require('discord.js-aliases'); // you now have aliases back! \o/
```
